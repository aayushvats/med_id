# Med Id
Med Id is basically a combination of software and hardware to create a Universal Medical Identity. to keep track of patients medical history.

## How does it operate
We use RFID Cards for the patients to generate a unique identity card for each patient. When the RFID Card is scanned, we will get all the medical details of the beholder.
All of the medical ohistory of the patient is pre recorded, and displayed on the app.
The has another functionality where the patient can give the prescription written by the doctor, and then all the prescribed medicines aong with the details of the doctors gets displayed on the app.
